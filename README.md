The aim of this work is to apply machine learning on a recent open-ended research.
In this report, a machine learning classifier was developed to help predict color and texture. 

This project accounts for 
• How to select and train a suitable classification model
• How to evaluate and compare the performance of different models with the objective of choosing 
which is the best.
• How to explain and justify a work in a technical report.


The dataset used in this report work is based on a subset of the GQA dataset for learning about relation. 
The dataset was split into two; the train and test dataset. The train dataset provides a ground for the model 
to learn on how to correctly classifier the targets. Whereas, the test dataset served as a real-world data with 
targets unknown. The dataset consists of images annotated in terms of boundary boxes and contains relevant 
attributes and relations
